[00:10.68] Guy in a pink top
[00:12.46] Walkin' like he got everything ready already
[00:20.50] Guy in a pink top
[00:22.58] Chased me down the block and followed my eyes
[00:29.36] And said to me
[00:36.36] 
[00:51.18] Guy in a pink top
[00:53.44] Said he likes my music, likes my perfume
[01:01.62] The guy in a pink top
[01:03.83] Said he'll let me do whatever I want
[01:09.99] And he said to me
[01:18.49] 
[01:12.08] It don't matter who you are
[01:16.84] It don't matter what you like
[01:22.06] It don't matter how you behave
[01:27.26] It don't matter how I dress
[01:31.55] As long as I walk my path
[01:35.31] Honey it don't matter
[01:45.81] 
[01:57.47] The guy in a pink top
[01:59.81] Said he likes my fashion, likes my perfume
[02:08.38] The guy in a pink top
[02:09.84] Asking us if he could dance on the floor
[02:16.48] And I said to him
[02:24.98] 
[02:18.32] It don't matter who you are
[02:23.45] It don't matter what you like
[02:28.32] It don't matter how you behave
[02:33.42] It don't matter how I dress
[02:38.67] It don't matter how you behave
[02:43.86] It don't matter how you dress
[02:48.36] As long as I walk my path
[02:51.91] Honey it don't matter
[03:02.41] 
[02:56.87] (Honey it don't matter
[03:02.43] Honey it don't matter
[03:07.40] Honey it don't matter
[03:12.53] Honey it don't matter
[03:17.33] Honey it don't matter
[03:22.48] Honey it don't matter)
